# NTP Kiss-of-Death (KoD) Attack Tool

A demonstration tool for various NTP server vulnerabilities through KoD (Kiss-of-Death) attack techniques. This tool is designed for educational purposes and authorized cybersecurity competitions only.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

**This tool is provided for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** to demonstrate potential vulnerabilities in NTP implementations. Using this tool against any targets without EXPLICIT AUTHORIZATION is ILLEGAL.

Use only in:
- Authorized cybersecurity competitions
- Controlled lab environments with explicit permission
- Pentesting engagements with proper authorization

The author accepts no liability for misuse or damage caused by this tool.

## Overview

This script demonstrates several techniques that could potentially crash or impair vulnerable NTP server implementations:

- **Malformed Packets**: Sending invalidly formatted NTP packets to trigger implementation bugs
- **Rate Limiting**: Overwhelming the server with many valid-looking requests
- **Large Packets**: Sending oversized NTP packets that some implementations may handle incorrectly
- **Fragmented Headers**: Using unusual header combinations that might trigger edge cases
- **Restriction Triggering**: Crafting packets to potentially trigger rate limiting mechanisms
- **Amplification Attacks**: Targeting mode 7 commands that may cause amplified responses
- **IP Spoofing**: Randomizing source IP addresses to evade detection and rate limiting

## Dependencies

The script requires:

- Python 3.6+
- Scapy library

### Installation

Install Python dependencies
pip install scapy

On Linux, you may need additional permissions for packet crafting
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev # For Debian/Ubuntu


## Usage

Basic syntax:

sudo python3 ntp-kod-attack.py --target TARGET_IP [options]


Root/administrator privileges are required for raw packet manipulation with Scapy.

### Command-line Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `--target` | Target NTP server IP address | (Required) |
| `--port` | Target NTP port | 123 |
| `--threads` | Number of threads to use | 4 |
| `--duration` | Attack duration in seconds | 30 |
| `--technique` | Attack technique to use (all, malformed, rate, large, fragment, restrict, amplification) | all |
| `--intensity` | Attack intensity level (1-10) | 5 |
| `--spoof` | Enable IP spoofing | False |

### Example Commands

Basic attack using all techniques:
sudo python3 ntp-kod-attack.py --target 192.168.1.10


Focused attack using only malformed packets with high intensity:
sudo python3 ntp-kod-attack.py --target 192.168.1.10 --technique malformed --intensity 8 --duration 60


Attack with IP spoofing enabled:
sudo python3 ntp-kod-attack.py --target 192.168.1.10 --spoof --intensity 7


Low-intensity testing with fewer threads:
sudo python3 ntp-kod-attack.py --target 192.168.1.10 --threads 2 --intensity 3 --duration 15


## General Workflow

1. **Script Initialization**:
   - Parses command-line arguments
   - Displays banner and disclaimer
   - Validates target IP
   - Requests explicit confirmation to proceed

2. **Attack Execution**:
   - Creates threads based on specified parameters
   - Each thread generates packets according to the selected technique
   - Packets are sent at a rate determined by the intensity level
   - Random timing jitter is applied to evade pattern detection
   - A monitoring thread checks if the target NTP service remains responsive

3. **Monitoring and Feedback**:
   - Real-time reporting on packets sent per thread
   - NTP service availability monitoring
   - Color-coded console output for easy status tracking

4. **Termination**:
   - Runs for the specified duration or until interrupted
   - Gracefully stops all threads and reports final status

## Setting Up a Testing Environment

For safe and legal testing, set up a controlled lab environment:

### Option 1: Virtual Machine Setup

1. Create two VMs on the same isolated virtual network:
   - Attacker VM: Linux with Python and Scapy installed
   - Target VM: Running NTP server software (e.g., ntpd, chrony)

2. Configure the NTP server on the target VM:
   ```bash
   # For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get install ntp
   sudo systemctl start ntp
Verify the NTP server is listening:

sudo netstat -tulnp | grep 123
From the attacker VM, run the tool against the target VM IP.

Option 2: Docker-based Environment
Create a docker network:

docker network create ntp-test-network
Run an NTP server container:

docker run --name ntp-server --network ntp-test-network -d cturra/ntp
Run an attacker container with the script:

docker run --name attacker --network ntp-test-network -it ubuntu:latest # Then install dependencies and run the script
Monitoring the Effects
To observe the effects of the attack:

On the target server, monitor system logs: tail -f /var/log/syslog
Watch NTP server process: top -p $(pgrep ntpd)
Check NTP service status: ntpq -p
Monitor network traffic: tcpdump -i any udp port 123 -vv
Advanced Features
IP Spoofing
The --spoof option enables source IP address randomization to:

Evade rate limiting based on source IP
Make the attack harder to trace
Potentially bypass simple firewall rules
Note: IP spoofing requires root privileges and may not work on all networks due to egress filtering.

Timing Randomization
The script implements:

Variable delays between packet bursts
Randomized packet timing within bursts
Jitter in the overall packet rate
These features help evade detection systems that look for regular traffic patterns.

Responsible Use
Always obtain proper authorization before testing
Document your testing activities
Report vulnerabilities responsibly to software vendors
Use minimum necessary intensity for educational purposes
Troubleshooting
Permission errors: Ensure you're running the script with root/administrator privileges
Scapy issues: Check Scapy installation and dependencies
Firewall blocking: Verify firewall rules allow UDP traffic on port 123
IP spoofing not working: Some networks implement egress filtering that prevents spoofed packets
Performance issues: Reduce intensity or number of threads if your system is overwhelmed
Version History
v1.0: Initial release with basic KoD techniques
v1.1: Added IP spoofing, amplification attacks, and timing randomization
